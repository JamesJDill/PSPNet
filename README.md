## Getting Started
  - Ensure that you are using the environment cv_proj5, which you can install using the install script conda/install.sh.
---

## Logistics
- Additional information can be found in `docs/project-5.pdf`.

## Important Notes
- Do **not** use absolute paths in your code or your code will break.
- Use relative paths like the starter code already does.
